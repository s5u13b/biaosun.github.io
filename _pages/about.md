# Biography

I am a R&D engineer (started from 07/2024) at [Platform of Artificial Intelligence (PAI)](https://www.aliyun.com/product/pai), [Alibaba Cloud](https://cn.aliyun.com/). Currently, I am mainly working on building [Llumnix](https://github.com/AlibabaPAI/llumnix), a dynamic scheduling system for large language model serving (still a long way to go :)). Besides, I am maintaining [EasyCkpt](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/pai/user-guide/easyckpt), a high performance asynchronous checkpointing framework for large language model training, accelerating [Qwen2.5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15115) and [Qwen3](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3/blob/main/Qwen3_Technical_Report.pdf) training.

Prior to that, I received my M.Eng. degree from the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/) at [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/) in June 2024, advised by [Prof. Hailong Yang](https://thomas-yang.github.io/). And I received my B.Eng. degree from the [School of Software Engineering](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/sse/) at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/) in June 2021.

# Intern Experience

<div class='paper-box-text' markdown="1">
- Platform of Artificial Intelligence, **Alibaba Cloud**, Beijing. (06/2023 - 06/2024)
  
  *Intern R&D Engineer*
  - Design and develop the prototype system of Llumnix. Llumnix proposes a dynamic scheduling policy that reschedules requests and their in-memory states with an efficient and scalable live migration mechanism, improving load balancing and isolation, mitigating resource fragmentation, and differentiating request priorities and SLOs.
